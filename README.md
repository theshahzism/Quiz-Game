# Quiz-Game

A quiz game, made in the first semester as complex engineering project of CS-115 Computer Programming.
The project also contains graphical user interface and was made using the concepts of structural Python programming and Tkinter library.
This was the very first programming project I've ever worked in as a team member.

This was the project assigned by our instructors to us 3 people that needed to be submitted to them by the deadline.
The GUI was not the mandatory requirement but we used the library to earn extra marks.
I, in collaboration with those two brilliant students, first decided the flow of game and then started coding the whole project in categories.
The functionalities like calculating the overall score and storing it in the files was a hectic task at the first galance.
But the dedication and consistency proved to be finishing factors of our project.
